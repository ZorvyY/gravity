Projectiles with gravity

THis is a simple 2d gravity simulation written in pure javascript. The only external library used was webpack for development.

To add a particle, click on at the desired location and drag to specify the velocity. The mass can be set in the input below the canvas. Enjoy.

> _If there's one thing you take away from this, never forget: Always use a symplectic integrator when simulating hamiltonian systems._
