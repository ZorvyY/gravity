~~Add acceleration vectors option, and make particle vectors optional~~

Use scss to make view full screen
Use web workers to increase performance (move computation off main thread)
Add state saving option, and you should be able to do various preset simulation options.
~~Increase performance of integration methods (Runge kutta is crushing it)~~
